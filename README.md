# Deep-learning-with-low-code
Deep learning with low code libraries assignment for CMPE 258 Deep learning

Part A: FastAI.ipynb
- Was not able to do object detection due to fastAI not having models/APIs that support object detection.

Part B: Huggingface Transformers.ipynb

Part C: Keras-NLP
- Slightly different libraries used due to compatibility issues with windows. Unable to run custom notebook via colab due to memory constraints.

Part D: Keras-VC
- Slightly different libraries used due to compatibility issues with windows. Unable to run custom notebook via colab due to memory constraints.
